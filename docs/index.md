# Welcome to HRI Teleoperation Tutorial

If you wish to develop cool algorithm or experiments using our teleoperation platform, you are in the right place!

## Code Editor

You will need [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), so download it and install it before diving in!

### Extensions

To get the best from VS Code, we suggest that you install the following extensions

- [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python): fundamental coding languages support (previewing function arguments and a lot more);
- [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack): very useful to work remotely on powerful shared working stations.
- [Container Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-containers): similarly, but for programming "virtual machines".
- [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph): basic software versioning visualization client.

The [tutorial](tutorial.md) section will guide you to the installation of all of the software components you will need!
